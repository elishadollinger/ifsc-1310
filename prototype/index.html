          <p>Kendrick Lamar and Drake, <em>real name Aubrey Graham</em>, began one of the longest - and most interesting - rap beefs in 
          2024. This beef began when the rapper J. Cole claimed that him, Drake and Kendrick Lamar were the <q>big three of rap</q> in 
          the song <em>First Person Shooter</em>. This offended Lamar, who replied on his <strong>feature</strong> in the song 
          <em>Like That</em> with Future and Metro Boomin. In this reply, he stated the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>These <strong>******</strong> talkin' out of they necks</li>
              <li><strong>****</strong> sneak dissin' first-person shooter</li>
              <li><strong>*********</strong> the big three, <strong>*****</strong> it's just big me.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Little did Lamar know, however, this would set off the most iconic rap beef in the modern era.</p>

          <h3 id="firstresponses">Drake's First Responses: Push Ups and Taylor Made Freestyle</h3>
          <p>After hearing <em>Like That</em>, Drake released his two diss tracks of the feud, these being <em>Push Ups</em> and 
          <em>Taylor Made Freestyle</em>. The first diss track didn't do much, as Drake just claimed that Lamar was short and that 
          he paid 50% of his ownings to the label he was signed to. However, the second diss track used AI Voices of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg. 
          These AI voices were used to bait Lamar into replying to him, and, well, <em>it did just that</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="section-next">
          <h4 id="next">The Next Disses: Euphoria and Family Matters</h4>
          <p>After hearing <em>Taylor Made Freestyle</em>, Lamar had had enough. Lamar then replied with the song "Euphoria". This song 
          was absolutely ruthless, and contained the infamous lines:</p>
          <blockquote>
            It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater. I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, 
            I hate the way that you dress. I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct. We hate the ******* 
            you ****, 'cause they confuse themself with real women. And notice, I said "we, " it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'.
          </blockquote>
          <p>Basically, Kendrick was just saying that he <strong>really</strong> hates Drake. This angered Drake, who went on to release his 
          second diss track, <em>Family Matters</em>. This diss track claimed various things, including that Kendrick beats his wife and 
          gets everything he wants handed to him.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="section-aftermath">
          <h5 id="aftermath">The Aftermath of Family Matters</h5>
          <p>30 minutes after <em>Family Matters</em>, Lamar released <em>Meet the Grahams</em>. This diss track was absolutely 
          <strong>diabolical</strong>, as it dissed Drake's entire family(and Drake) in this order:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Drake's Son - <em>addressed as Adonis</em></li>
            <li>Drake's Mom - <em>addressed as Sandra</em></li>
            <li>Drake's Dad - <em>addressed as Dennis</em></li>
            <li>Drake's Alleged Daughter - <em>addressed as Baby Girl</em></li>
            <li>Drake - <em>addressed as Drake</em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>After this, Lamar released <em>Not Like Us</em>, which <strong>just went on to win five Grammy's</strong>. With the definitions 
          of certain lyrics below, you can assume what this diss track is about:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pedophile</dt>
            <dd>Somebody who is attracted to minors.</dd>
            <dt>Minor</dt>
            <dd>Someone under the age of 18.</dd>
            <dt>Jabroni</dt>
            <dd>Nobody knows what this one means - I just thought it was cool because it was a reference to The Rock.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>After these two disses, Drake became considered as a whimp by the public, and Kendrick's career skyrocketed more than it already 
          had. A table of following notable moments after the beef is listed below:</p>
