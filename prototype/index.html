          <p>Ye, or <strong>more commonly known</strong> as Kanye West, is an American rapper and producer. Although he <em>initially</em>  
          began making waves in the music industry through his unique producing style, he always had aspirations of becoming a rapper. 
          Eventually, Ye was given the opportunity to rap. His first album, <em>The College Dropout</em>, gained praise everywhere and
           has become one of the most critically acclaimed albums in all of hip-hop.
