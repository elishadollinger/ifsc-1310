          <p>Kendrick Lamar and Drake, <em>real name Aubrey Graham</em>, began one of the longest - and most interesting - rap beefs in 
          2024. This beef began when the rapper J. Cole claimed that him, Drake and Kendrick Lamar were the <q>big three of rap</q> in 
          the song <em>First Person Shooter</em>. This offended Lamar, who replied on his <strong>feature</strong> in the song 
          <em>Like That</em> with Future and Metro Boomin. In this reply, he stated the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>These <strong>******</strong> talkin' out of they necks</li>
              <li><strong>****</strong> sneak dissin' first-person shooter</li>
              <li><strong>*********</strong> the big three, <strong>*****</strong> it's just big me.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Little did Lamar know, however, this would set off the most iconic rap beef in the modern era.</p>
