      <h2>Why does NASA send rovers to Mars?</h2>
      <p>NASA sends robotic rovers to Mars to study its geology, climate, and potential for past life. These missions help us understand the Red Planet and prepare for future human exploration.</p>

      <h2>Which rovers have explored Mars?</h2>
      <p>So far, NASA has sent several successful rovers: Sojourner (1997), Spirit and Opportunity (2004), and Curiosity (2012). Each built on the success of the one before it.</p>

      <h2>What is the difference between Spirit and Opportunity?</h2>
      <p>Spirit and Opportunity were twin rovers with identical designs but landed in different locations. Spirit explored Gusev Crater, while Opportunity landed in Meridiani Planum. Opportunity outlived Spirit by several years due to better conditions and a fortunate landing site.</p>

      <h2>What were the goals of Spirit and Opportunity?</h2>
      <p>Their primary mission was to search for signs of past water activity on Mars. Both found strong evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface.</p>

      <h2>How long did Spirit and Opportunity last?</h2>
      <p>They were expected to last 90 Martian days (sols), but Spirit operated for over 6 years and Opportunity for nearly 15 years, setting longevity records.</p>

      <h2>What did Curiosity discover on Mars?</h2>
      <p>Curiosity confirmed that Mars once had conditions suitable for microbial life. It found ancient lakebeds, clay minerals, and organic molecules—building blocks of life.</p>

      <h2>What’s special about Curiosity’s design?</h2>
      <p>Curiosity is much larger than earlier rovers. It uses a nuclear power source instead of solar panels, carries a laser to vaporize rocks, and has a full science lab onboard.</p>

      <h2>How do the rovers land on Mars?</h2>
      <p>Earlier rovers like Sojourner used airbags to bounce on landing. Spirit and Opportunity used parachutes and retro rockets. Curiosity used a sky crane—a system that lowered the rover from a hovering platform for a gentle touchdown.</p>

      <h2>What is a sol?</h2>
      <p>A sol is one Martian day. It’s about 24 hours and 39 minutes long, slightly longer than an Earth day.</p>

      <h2>Can the rovers be driven like remote-control cars?</h2>
      <p>No. Because of the communication delay between Earth and Mars, engineers send a list of instructions each sol. Rovers use onboard systems to complete tasks autonomously.</p>

      <h2>How do rovers navigate the Martian terrain?</h2>
      <p>They use onboard cameras and software to detect obstacles, map terrain, and plan safe driving routes each day.</p>

      <h2>How do the rovers send data back to Earth?</h2>
      <p>Rovers communicate with orbiters around Mars, which then relay the data to Earth using high-gain antennas.</p>

      <h2>What was Sojourner’s mission?</h2>
      <p>Sojourner was the first successful Mars rover, part of the 1997 Pathfinder mission. Its job was to test rover mobility and send back surface data and images.</p>

      <h2>What happens when a rover stops working?</h2>
      <p>Once a rover becomes unresponsive due to damage, dust, or system failure, NASA ends the mission. The rover stays on Mars as a silent artifact of exploration.</p>
