    <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progresive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Coming into this class, I knew nothing about how to operate a website. I believed that this class would be another 
      weedout class that was unenjoyable. However, this has been the class that I have learned the most in this semester. I came into this class thinking that websites were coded through CSS or Python. However, I quickly learned that the website coding process uses its own language and strategies.</p>
  <p>I believe that I effeciently integrated CSS during this class. While I initially had no understanding of CSS, I feel like I quickly picked up the design process. For example, I quickly learned how to use flex-direction and text-align. Additionally, I learned how to alter text and background colors and how to integrate background images. Overall, CSS was the part of this class I enjoyed the most and the area that I have seen the most progression in.</p>
  <p>If I had to restart this course, I would interact more in class. While I paid attention to the lectures, I did not regularly chime in when a question was asked, interact with my classmates or attend the lab sessions on Fridays. None of these were mandatory; however, I believe that I would have benefited in all of my classes by participating in this class. Additionally, if I interacted more in this class, I would have been more motivated to participate around campus this semester.</p>
  <p>I noticed that most of my feedback from this class was positive. However, I got negative feedback when I forgot to close an unordered list on my website. While this was a simple fix, a major assignment was not prevalent on my website. To fix this mistake, I simply closed the UL using <q>&lt/ul&gt</q>. This illustrated that a simple error in HTML can cause a potentially fatal website error.</p>
