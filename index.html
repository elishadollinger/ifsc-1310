  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement focuses on the content of a website. Progressive enhancement begins with raw HTML content. Next, progressive enhancement applies CSS to a website. Finally, progressive enhancement applies JavaScript to a website. After this step is complete, a website has been successfully designed with progressive enhancement.</p>
    <p>Progressive enhancement consists of multiple principles. Expectations of progressive enhancement include website content and functionality being available on all web browsers, enhanced layout being provided by external CSS, enhance behavior being provided by external JavaScript files, and the respect of end-user web browser preferences.</p>
    <p>Progressive enhancement gives structure to modern website development. In order to develop a website, you have to know what the website is about. Progressive enhancement utilizes this, telling a user to incorporate the HTML structure first. Next, you have to know what you want your website to look like. Progressive enhancement utilizes this by telling a user to incorporate CSS, giving a website a good look. Finally, you must know how you want your website to handle user interactions. Progressive enhancement utilizes this, allowing you to get the essential website design and content before user interaction is designed. Overall, progressive enhancement gives a simple and straightforward approach to website development.</p>

    <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      After getting my project peer reviewed, it was brought to my attention that the color scheme on the header links 
      makes them difficult to read. The blue is too dark, and the green background does not improve the readability for 
      said text. Furthermore, the links to the links in the header are too close together, which makes the website look worse.
       The headers also differ depending on the page you are on, and the color scheme differs by page on the website. The final
        piece of criticism that I got was that there was no option to return to the main page of the website in the header. 
        To fix this, I plan on putting more space between the options in the header, changing the color scheme of the links
        in the header, creating a consistent header/color scheme within all pages and creating an option to return to the
        main page of the website.
    </p>
    <p>Coming into this class, I knew nothing about how to operate a website. I believed that this class would be another 
      weedout class that was unenjoyable. However, this has been the class that I have learned the most in this semester. 
      I came into this class thinking that websites were coded through CSS or Python. However, I quickly learned that the 
      website coding process uses its own language and strategies.</p>
  <p>I believe that I effeciently integrated CSS during this class. While I initially had no understanding of CSS, I feel 
    like I quickly picked up the design process. For example, I quickly learned how to use flex-direction and text-align. 
    Additionally, I learned how to alter text and background colors and how to integrate background images. Overall, CSS was 
    the part of this class I enjoyed the most and the area that I have seen the most progression in.</p>
  <p>If I had to restart this course, I would interact more in class. While I paid attention to the lectures, I did not 
    regularly chime in when a question was asked, interact with my classmates or attend the lab sessions on Fridays. 
    None of these were mandatory; however, I believe that I would have benefited in all of my classes by participating in this 
    class. Additionally, if I interacted more in this class, I would have been more motivated to participate around campus 
    this semester.</p>
  <p>I noticed that most of my feedback from this class was positive. However, I got negative feedback when I forgot to close 
    an unordered list on my website. While this was a simple fix, a major assignment was not prevalent on my website. To fix 
    this mistake, I simply closed the UL using <q>&lt/ul&gt</q>. This illustrated that a simple error in HTML can cause a 
    potentially fatal website error.</p>
